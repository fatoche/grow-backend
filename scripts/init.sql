-- Initial database setup for GROW backend
-- This script runs when the PostgreSQL container starts for the first time

-- The database and user are already created via environment variables
-- in docker-compose.yml, so we don't need to create them here

-- You can add any additional initialization here, such as:
-- - Creating indexes
-- - Setting up roles/permissions
-- - Adding initial data
